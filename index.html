            Evelyn is telling the story of her exotic love life to a journalist who is looking for a big break in the
            company she is working for. Through the novel, the journalist questions why Evelyn specifically chose her to

            The story contains a major plot twist and has many love triangles, drama, and explores the ugly truth of
            Hollywood behind the scenes.
